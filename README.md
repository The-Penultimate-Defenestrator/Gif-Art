# Gif-Art
Python scripts using PIL and images2GIF to make animated generative art.

Two of these animations are rewritten from animations found on [this blog post](http://zulko.github.io/blog/2014/09/20/vector-animations-with-python/), but neither of these are directly copied. They have both been rewritten to use `PIL` instead of `Gizeh`, and `images2gif` instead of `MoviePy`
